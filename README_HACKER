    - /!\ important/!\ you have to rename your camera "Camera_"+ [your level name] and all objects in your level should begin by [your level name] + "_"
    - You have to set spawnpoints for your players, create two empty (with the same y coordinates) and name them [your level name]+"_spawnPos_p1" and [your level name]+"_spawnPos_p2"
